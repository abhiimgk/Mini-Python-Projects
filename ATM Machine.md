ATMs are machines that dispense cash and allow you to make other banking transactions. An ATM typically consists of a screen, a card reader, a keypad,
a cash dispenser and a printer.
Here I have used the same principle for designing it.
At first user will have to enter the pin for exploiting the ATM services. If user pin is correct, he will get displayed the message of choosing the services.
A total of 3 chances will be given to enter the correct pin, otherwise message of wring pin and use after 24 hours will be displayed.
Here user can withdraw cash, deposit cash and see bank balance.I have attached the ATM machine py file containing the code.
