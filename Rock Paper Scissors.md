Rock, Paper, Scissors. The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. 
Here game will be played between computer and the user. A best of 3 rounds system is designed as such for every win in a round, winner gets 1 point while loser gets 0 point. For a draw between them again 0 point is shared. At the end of 3 rounds player with the maximum points will be declared as the winner.
Here I have used the input function to get user's choice for his play.
For creating 3 rounds While loop is used.
Use of control statements=if,else is also done.
Rest you can view the code, I have attached py file of this game containing the code.
